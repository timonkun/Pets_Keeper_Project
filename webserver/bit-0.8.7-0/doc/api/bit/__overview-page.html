    <h1>Embedthis Bit</h1>
    <p>Bit means Build It, and it is a modern replacement for the venerable make and not so popular autoconf utilities. </p>
    <p>Bit manages the building of programs and products by simply and efficiently determining which pieces have been updated and thus which components need to be rebuilt. It easily handles the direct compilation and generation of projects and Makefiles.</p>
